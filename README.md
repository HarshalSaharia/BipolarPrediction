# Predicting Bipolar Disorder Prevalence Using Machine Learning

This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the prevalence of bipolar disorders based on various mental health indicators. The dataset used includes information on schizophrenia, depressive, anxiety, and eating disorders across multiple countries and years. By employing Random Forest Regressor, we aim to build a robust model that can provide accurate predictions and insights into the relationships between different mental health disorders.
